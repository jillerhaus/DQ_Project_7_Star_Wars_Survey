# DataQuest Project 7: Star Wars Survey

This is the seventh project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project data from a survey on the Star Wars franchise was analyzed. The main focus of the analysis was on the differences in viewing habits and ratings between women and men as well as analyzing how the different movies were rated and how often which movie was viewed. The focus on the project as a whole was on data cleaning.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file containing the raw data on the survey.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install) The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Pandas` and `matplotlib` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
